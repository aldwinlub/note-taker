# note-taker

## Overview
This project allows the user to be presented at a home page called "Note Taker" with a url of "/" through "localhost:3000". The user would then be presented with a button that leads to a whole new page where they are able to create a note through a note title and a description of said note. They would be able to save it and also display the note that they just created on the left side of the page. A delete option would also be available in order to delete said note title and description.
